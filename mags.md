# Magtheridon's Lair (Mags)

25-man raid. 4 tanks (at least 3). 8-10 healers. You need classes that can interrupt. You'll need 4 locks.

In progress... [in the meanwhile check this video from Crix Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjIAVswTOHc)

## Attunement

No attunement.

## Bosses

- [Magtheridon](#Magtheridon)

The 4 trash packs act like mini bosses. Each pack has 3 adds. You need to kill.

Assign 2 interurpters to each channeler (3 for safety).

Priest should mass dispel shadow word pain (shield yourself first to mitigate damage of dispelling a Unstable Affliction).

Do not be close to **Hellfire Warder**, they do 10 yards shadow nova AoE (3k dmg).

### Magtheridon

Have a look at [diagram](./mags.png). At each number there is a __Hellfire Channeler__. The dots are the classes. Place MT and OT at 1 tanking add1,add2,add3 (unter's redirect on 3). OT tanks at 4 add4,add5 (hunter's redirect 5). Rest of the group around 1 spread.  At phase 2 (mag released) tank it at circle (max range to raid). When add1, add2 are dead. OT moves from 1 to 4 and picks one of the add from OT at 4.

#### Phase 1

__Burning Abyssal__ do not kill (they respawn). Keep them in CC (freezing trap, fear, vanish).

Must interrupt __Shadow Bolt Volley__ and __Dark Mending__ from channelers. Assign 2 interruptors per add (one interrupts only shadow bolt and the other only dark mending).

__Fear__ single target, cannot be cured by tremor.

When add die __Soul Transfer__ to another add (+20% dmg, 10% cast speed).

#### Phase 2

Long and boring. Stay behind boss (uses __Cleave__).

__Quake__(every 50s): small knockbacks every second for 6 seconds.

__Conflagration__: move away from fire on the ground.

__Blast Nova__(every 45s): channeled (massive dmg per second). Intrrupt by clicking the 5 cubes (__Manticron Cube__) at the same time.

Assign 3 sets of clickers (can't click again in 2'). Assign 5 dps to each set. Move to your assigned cube before the cast. Click the cube once (it will channel). Stop channeling as soon as the __nova__ is interrupted (mag takes 300%dmg but you take 900dmg/s).

#### Phase 3 (30%)

Same abilities as in phase 2.

Don't Phase 3 before a __Blast Nova__ since ceiling collapse stuns the entire raid.

Ceiling will fall and do 6k to everyone. Use Healthstone and Tranquility after this.

After the initial break, the roof will collapse but you can dodge it (dodge or die).
