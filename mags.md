# Magtheridon's Lair (Mags)

25-man raid. 4 tanks (at least 3). 8-10 healers. You need classes that can interrupt. You'll need 4 locks.

## Attunement

No attunement.

## Bosses

- [Magtheridon](#Magtheridon)

### Mob packs

Each pack has 3 adds.

Assign 2 interurpters to each channeler.

Priest should mass dispel shadow word pain (shield yourself first to mitigate damage of dispelling a Unstable Affliction).

Do not be close to **Hellfire Warder**, they do 10 yards shadow nova AoE (3k dmg).

### Magtheridon

Have a look at [this hand-made diagram](./mags.png). At each number there is a __Hellfire Channeler__. Place MT and OT at 1 tanking add1,add2,add3 (hunter's redirect on 3). OT tanks at 4 add4,add5 (hunter's redirect 5). Rest of the group around 1 spread. When add1, add2 are dead. OT moves from 1 to 4 and picks one of the add from OT at 4.

#### Phase 1

__Burning Abyssal__ do not kill (they respawn). Keep them in CC (freezing trap, fear, vanish). They do AoE dmg.

Must interrupt __Shadow Bolt Volley__ and __Dark Mending__ from channelers. Assign 2 interruptors per add (one interrupts only shadow bolt and the other only dark mending).

__Fear__ single target, cannot be cured by tremor.

When add die __Soul Transfer__ to another add (+30% dmg and cast speed).

#### Phase 2

Long and boring. Stay behind boss (uses __Cleave__).

__Quake__(every 50s): small knockbacks every second for 6 seconds.

__Conflagration__: move away from fire on the ground.

__Blast Nova__(every 60s): channeled (massive dmg per second). Intrrupt by clicking the 5 cubes (__Manticron Cube__) at the same time.

Assign 3 sets of clickers (can't click again in 30"). Assign 5 dps to each set. Move to your assigned cube before the cast. Click the cube once (it will channel). Stop channeling as soon as the __nova__ is interrupted (mag takes 300%dmg but the player clicking takes 400dps).

#### Phase 3 (30%)

Same abilities as in phase 2.

Ceiling will fall and do 6k to everyone. Use Healthstone and Tranquility after this.

Don't phase it before a __Blast Nova__ since ceiling collapse stuns the entire raid.

After the initial break, the roof will collapse periodically. You must dodge it.
