#### Phase 1

4 Tanks, 3 upstairs(each tank controls 2 platforms), 1 downstairs (adds)

At each platform switch, adds will spawn.

Adds explode on death, stay away.

#### Phase 2

__Melt Armor__: switch tanks.

__Meteor__: group in the meteor landing and kill the adds (they explode on death).

### Void Reaver

Throws big energy balls to the casters, deal a lof dmg and silence. You need to move around (very annoying)

### High Astromancer Solarian

1 Group in the middle with debuff.

__Wrath of the Astromancer__: wait until first debug (5 seconds) expires, and then move to debuff (30 seconds) group. Go back to your group when the 30 seconds debuff explires.

Every 50s, adds will spawn, just AoE them.

Kill Priests.

#### Phase 3 (Voidwalker)

#### Phase 3 (advisors)

All advisors together.

Kill order: Thaladred > Sanguinar > Telonicus > Capernian

__Fireball__: kick them

__Flamestrike__: move away

#### Phase 5

Phase 4 - Pyroblast + Gravity Lapse.

__Gravity Lapse__: move away from Kael'thas, spread out, before the end go near the groud (dont touch it). Phoenix become immune
