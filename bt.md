6-8 Healers (3-4 healers on MT, rest on raid).

Soulstones on healers marked with Shadow of Death.

Bloodlust at the beginning.

**Incinerate***(dispel): 8,325 fire damage over three seconds.

**Shadow of Death**: Cast every 30 seconds on a random target and applies a debuff which kills the target after 55 seconds. When the target dies (by the debuff or any other reason), four Shadowy Constructs spawn at the target's corpse and the target turns into a Ghost for 60 seconds. Avoid it while being casted with Vanish, Feign Death, Divine Shield or Ice Block.

15 seconds before **Shadow of Death** runs out, run to the right or left corner.

Shadowy Constructs can only be attacked by Ghost players.

Ghost must kite and kill Shadowy Constructs before they get into the raid and wipe.

#### Phase 1

3 groups of five people each need to be pre-designed as Bloodboil soakers. Take BB by turns.

**Bloodboil(BB)**: debuff cast every 10 sec on the five raid members furthest away from Gurtogg, dealing 600 damage per sec for 24 sec. Not resistible or dispellable, resilience and Shadow Embrace reduce the damage taken. Can be removed with Divine Shield and Iceblock.

**Acidic Wound**: at 10 stacks of Acidic Would, MT swaps for OT and waits 60 seconds to reset stacks.

**Bewildering Strike***: Disorients the current target.

A third tank is needed when MT is acidic wounded, and the OT gets disoriented.

#### Phase 2

Spread to avoid geyser.

**Acid Geyser***: 5k nature damage 5 yard AoE on and around the FR target at the start of phase 2

**Insignificance**: All raid members get this resistible buff. Insignificant players cannot cause threat

**Fel Rage (FR)** debuff increases armor, health, healing/dmg done, size and Gurtogg will only attack this player until death. FR should **not*** move, raid should move away from Gurtoggs frontal cone attacks.

All tank healers must swap to FR player and the raid healers should heal all BB affected players.
