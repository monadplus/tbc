### Rage Winterchill

DPS race, 10 minutes enrage. If Jaina dies the event is reset.

1 MT

**Icebolt**: wear your pvp trinket, or use ice block, bubble,...

**Death and Decay**: red area on the ground (very subtle), move away from the raid.

### Anetheron

DPS race, 10 minutes enrage.

1 MT on boss Anetheron

1 Tank on add Towering Infernal

**Carrion Swarm**(spread): cone, -75% healing.

Rogues should keep Wound Poison active on the boss at all times, to reduce the effect of his **Vampiric Aura**.

**Sleep** 3 targets for 10 seconds

Spaws a *Towering Infernal* every 60 on a random raid member. Infernals can't be taunted, let the tank aggro properly. Ranged Dps on it.

### Kaz'rogal

DPS race

1 MT

Thrall and his NPC do like 15% of total dmg

**Mark of Kaz'rogal**: mark, drains your mana, and when you oom, you explode. If you are going oom, move away from the raid

Druids can shift to bear to avoid death from the mark

### Azgalor

Survival battle

1 MT Boss (next to Thrall)

1-2 Off-tank on Lesser Doomguards (in case one of them gets Doom)(next to tauren camp).

The Doomguard tanks need two healers, the Azgalor tank three. The other healers should keep up the raid.

**Doom**: in 20 seconds you are gonna die. Move with the OT and ask for a soulstone. When you die, you spawn a Lesser Doomguard, nuke it.

__Rain of Fire__: move away

__Silence__: nothing you can do

### Archimonde

Survival Battle (1 death = 1 charge of Soul). Avoid dying at all cost

After 9 minutes (dmg is enough, dont rush it), wipe, 100k shadow damage to all the raid.

At < 10% health, win.

1 MT

1 shaman, 1 healer and 1 decurser per group.
Stay with your group and your totems but spread (air burst is in area).

6-10 Healers

Pick one Tear of Goddness from Tyrande.

Stamina is desirable in this battle.

**Air Burst**(spread): use the tear.

**Doomfire** (avoid)

**Fear**: Tremor Totem/Fear Ward. Pvp trinket helps when you are about to run into a doomfire.

**Grip of the Legion** (dispel quickly !)

**Soul Charge**: don\'t die.

**Finger of Death**: at least one meelee.
