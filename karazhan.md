# Karazhan (Kara)

10-man raid.

Raid composition: 2 tanks, 2-3 healers, 5-6 dps. At least 1 priest and warlock. A druid and shaman/paladin are also recommended. Paladin tank is great for trash mobs.

Gear: Max level dungeon + Gruul's Lair/Magtheridon's Lair.

Thrash Mobs: use cc as much as possible (Shackle Undead, etc.). 30' before respawn.

## Attunement

Master Key (only one person of the raid).
It is a long chain started at the entrance to the raid.
See [guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tbc/guides/karazhan-attunement/).

10 bosses.
