# Karazhan (Kara)

10-man raid.

Raid composition: 2 tanks, 3 healers, 5 dps (1 extra RDPS). At least 1 priest and warlock. A druid and shaman/paladin are also recommended.

Gear: Max level dungeon + Gruul's Lair/Magtheridon's Lair.

Thrash Mobs: use cc as much as possible (Shackle Undead, etc.). 30' before respawn.

## Attunement

Master Key (only one person of the raid).
It is a long chain started at the entrance to the raid.
See [guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tbc/guides/karazhan-attunement/).

## Bosses

10 bosses.

Moroes > Opera Event > The Curator > Chess Event > Prince (the rest are optional).

Koren <The Blacksmith>, next to Attumen the Huntsman, will repair gear for players who are Honored with Violet Eye.

### Attumen the Huntsman

#### Phase 1

OT tanks Midnight
MT tanks Attumen next to the horse.
Raid behind the horse.
Focus horse.
Attumen can be disarmed.
Decurse (Tank>RDPS>MDPS)

#### Phase 2: Midnight < 25%

Focus on Attumen.
Care, aggro on Attumen is wiped.
Attumen charge a RDPS, all raid stacked in meele range (ass).

### Moroes

Adds then Moroes
CC 3 out of 4 adds (freezing trap, shackle undead, turn evil, cyclone).
Otherwise, Dps can tank caster add.
Stunlock on focus add (kidney, intimidation, intercept, hoj).
MT on Moroes
OT on adds next to Moroes (cleave, consecration, wipe).
OT has to build aggro on Moroes since it will Gauge second highest aggro.
Vanish every 30 seconds and then Garrote (5' strong bleed) (iceblock, bubble, blessing of protection).

Reason for a wipe: OT not enough thread, Moroes kills healers. Not re-applying CC.
